                I come from a world of explorers. Fueled by my curiosity, I venture out into the unknown in search of hidden treasures. On my journeys, 
                I encounter many different paths, confront seemingly unpassable obstacles, and experience stunning revelations. Filled with unexpected challenges 
                and breathtaking encounters, my quests lead me deep into the wilderness, and always leave me with new avenues to explore. However, I do not leave my 
                house with a backpack, flashlight, and first-aid kit; armed with my pen and paper, I delve into the world of mathematics. Diving head first into the 
                realms of number theory, linear algebra, and topology, I witness the discoveries made by past mathematicians and experience my own revelations. Comparable 
                to a work of art or literature, math, with all of its twists and turns, has an undeniable beauty. I love learning and doing math because through it I get to share my story, 
                my personal adventure undertaken simply for the joy of discovering new things.

                As a rising sophomore at Yale University, I am currently pursuing a double major in computer science and math. With the problem-solving skills I gained
                from math and the power to reach millions through computer science, I hope to make my own impact on the world.
